Sadly, the available resources i researched did not give a distinct complete answer to the questions i had regarding GUI design under DirectX 11. Some suggested using a third party library such as CEGUI, GWEN or AntTweakBar (http://www.gamedev.net/topic/665823-directx-11-ui-library/). Others went on to implement everything themselves, including a separate rendering queue and possibly even an own thread for the UI (http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/directx-and-xna/developing-a-gui-using-c-and-directx-part-1-r994).

As it is not certain to this point, whether we are allowed to use third party libraries and the sources about custom implementations are neither complete, nor academically acceptable, i am going to display my own idea of concept for a possible GUI integration. This concept is built up on the ideas of popular game engines as Unity3D:

Each GameObject needs a flag which states if the object is a UI Element or not.
UI components are basically normal GameObjects which are rendered in screen coordinates (Both 2D and 3D UI Elements are possible this way).

The main menu will be a completely own scene (-graph) and all submenus within are just being hidden until relevant (The latter does work for the PauseMenu aswell).
